### What is this project for?

The main purpose of the project is to provide a super-quick start for decoupled applications development based on **Drupal 8** and **React.js**.

Our main goal was to create the boilerplate with minimal amount of opinionated set of features, but at the same time give developers a solid base for start to let them focus on the development and do not worry about infrastructure / integrations set up. 

### What does this project include?

We've got many little developers tricks and sugar included, but from the high level the project provides:

- One command installation experience for the whole development / testing infrastructure
- Docker configuration to avoid any necessity in third-party tools installation on your local machine
- Configured Drupal 8 application based on [Contenta CMS](http://www.contentacms.org) for comprehensive decoupled development
- Configured React.js application based on [Next.js]() for Server Side Rendering support and great developers experience
- 3 types of tests included (Unit / Integration, API, Acceptance) with examples, Drupal API integration & database connection
- [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) ready configuration—ã for those who want to run the project in web
- Simple commands for automated code quality checks / fixes
- Continues Integration / Deployment example for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) to deploy the application to [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh)
