### What is this project for?

The main purpose of the project is to provide a super-quick start for decoupled applications development based on **Drupal 8** and **React.js**.

Our main goal was to create the boilerplate with minimal amount of opinionated set of features, but at the same time give developers a solid base for start to let them focus on the development and do not worry about infrastructure / integrations set up.
